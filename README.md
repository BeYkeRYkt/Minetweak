Minetweak
---------
**About**

_Minetweak_ is the latest Minecraft server application programming interface(API) that will allow you to interact with the server unlike never before. Minetweak is very far from finished, we are boasting some major features, like Bukkit and Forge compatibility, we are also looking towards possibly a client mod that includes Forge and some more API that would allow our plugins to create blocks and maybe items, and possibly GUIs, without using Forge at all.

**Who made Minetweak?**

Logan Gorence is responsible for organizing the project, and coding a major part of the codebase. Many contributors from the community will help with this project likely, so I can't forget them. This project was written for the community, by the community.
