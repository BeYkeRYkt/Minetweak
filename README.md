Minetweak
---------
**About**

_Minetweak_ is the Minecraft server application programming interface(API) that will allow you to interact with the server unlike never before. Minetweak is very far from finished, we are boasting some major features, like Bukkit compatibility, we are also looking towards possibly a client mod that includes Forge and some more API that would allow our plugins to create GUIs and maybe customized items(e.g. better swords), and possibly blockss, without using Forge at all.
